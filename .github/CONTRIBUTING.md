## How to submit a pull request

The Gibbon philosophy is to perform small, easily tested changes to an ongoing development branch. An ideal pull request adds one feature or fixes one bug at a time. If you're unsure where to begin with GitHub feel free to reach out on the [Support forum](https://ask.gibbonedu.org) or check out these great guides: [makeapullrequest.com](http://makeapullrequest.com/) and [opensource.guide](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/)

1. Fork the [GibbonEdu/core](https://github.com/GibbonEdu/core) repository on GitHub and [clone a copy](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) on your local machine.
2. Write some code and push your changes to your repo using the command line or your [favourite](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/) Git GUI.
3. Create a [new pull request](https://github.com/GibbonEdu/core/pulls) and fill in the template provided to tell us about your change.
4. Be sure you're submitting your pull request to the development branch _(and not master)_.
5. Submissions should have a [changelog entry](https://github.com/GibbonEdu/core/blob/master/CHANGELOG.txt) noting what was added, changed or fixed.
