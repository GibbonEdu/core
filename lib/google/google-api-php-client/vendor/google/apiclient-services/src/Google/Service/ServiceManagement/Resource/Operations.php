   * @opt_param string filter A string for filtering Operations.   The following
   * filter fields are supported
   *
   *   * serviceName Required. Only `=` operator is allowed.   * startTime The
   * time this job was started, in ISO 8601 format.     Allowed operators are
   * `>=`,  `>`, `<=`, and `<`.   * status Can be `done`, `in_progress`, or
   * `failed`. Allowed     operators are `=`, and `!=`.
   *
   *   Filter expression supports conjunction (AND) and disjunction (OR)   logical
   * operators. However, the serviceName restriction must be at the   top-level
   * and can only be combined with other restrictions via the AND   logical
   * operator.
   *
   *   Examples
   *
   *   * `serviceName={some-service}.googleapis.com`   * `serviceName={some-
   * service}.googleapis.com AND startTime>="2017-02-01"`   * `serviceName={some-
   * service}.googleapis.com AND status=done`   * `serviceName={some-
   * service}.googleapis.com AND (status=done OR startTime>="2017-02-01")`
   * @opt_param string pageToken The standard list page token.
   * @opt_param string name Not used.
   * @opt_param int pageSize The maximum number of operations to return. If
   * unspecified, defaults to 50. The maximum value is 100.
