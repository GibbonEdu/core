## Contributing

Contributions to the vis.js library are very welcome! We can't do this alone.
You can contribute in different ways: spread the word, report bugs, come up with
ideas and suggestions, and contribute to the code.

There are a few preferences regarding code contributions:

- vis.js follows the node.js code style as described
  [here](http://nodeguide.com/style.html).
- When implementing new features, please update the documentation accordingly.
- Send pull requests to the `develop` branch, not the `master` branch.
- Only commit changes done in the source files under `lib`, not to the builds
  which are located in the folder `dist`.

Thanks!
