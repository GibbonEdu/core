     *                              - $parameters are the parameters that were passed to $method
     *                              - $initializer by-ref initializer - should be assigned null in the initializer body
     *                              - $properties a by-ref map of the properties of the object, indexed by PHP
     *                                            internal property name. Assign values to it to initialize the
     *                                            object state
     *
     * @param mixed[] $proxyOptions a set of options to be used when generating the proxy. Currently supports only
     *                              key "skippedProperties", which allows to skip lazy-loading of some properties.
     *                              "skippedProperties" is a string[], containing a list of properties referenced
     *                              via PHP's internal property name (i.e. "\0ClassName\0propertyName")
