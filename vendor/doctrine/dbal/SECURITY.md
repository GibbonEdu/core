Security
========

The Doctrine library is operating very close to your database and as such needs
to handle and make assumptions about SQL injection vulnerabilities.

It is vital that you understand how Doctrine approaches security, because
we cannot protect you from SQL injection.

Please read the documentation chapter on Security in Doctrine DBAL to
understand the assumptions we make.
