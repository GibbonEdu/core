   Before:

   use App\Mailer;

   class DefaultController
   {
       public function __construct(Mailer $mailer) {
           // ...
       }

       // ...
   }
   ```
   ```yml
   services:
       App\Controller\DefaultController:
           autowire: true
   ```

   After:

   ```php
   // same PHP code
   ```
   ```yml
   services:
       App\Controller\DefaultController:
           autowire: true

       # or
       # App\Controller\DefaultController:
       #     arguments: { $mailer: "@App\Mailer" }

       App\Mailer:
           autowire: true
    ```
