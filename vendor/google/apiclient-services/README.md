Google PHP API Client Services
==============================

## Requirements

[Google API PHP Client](https://github.com/googleapis/google-api-php-client/releases)

## Usage in v2 of Google API PHP Client

This library is automatically updated daily with new API changes, and tagged weekly.
It is installed as part of the 
[Google API PHP Client](https://github.com/googleapis/google-api-php-client/releases)
library via Composer, which will pull down the most recent tag.

## Usage in v1

If you are currently using the [`v1-master`](https://github.com/googleapis/google-api-php-client/tree/v1-master)
branch of the client library, but want to use the latest API services, you can
do so by requiring this library directly into your project via the same composer command:

```sh
composer require google/apiclient-services:dev-master
```
