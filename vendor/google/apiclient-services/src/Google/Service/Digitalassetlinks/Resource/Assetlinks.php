  /**
   * Determines whether the specified (directional) relationship exists between
   * the specified source and target assets.
   *
   * The relation describes the intent of the link between the two assets as
   * claimed by the source asset.  An example for such relationships is the
   * delegation of privileges or permissions.
   *
   * This command is most often used by infrastructure systems to check
   * preconditions for an action.  For example, a client may want to know if it is
   * OK to send a web URL to a particular mobile app instead. The client can check
   * for the relevant asset link from the website to the mobile app to decide if
   * the operation should be allowed.
   *
   * A note about security: if you specify a secure asset as the source, such as
   * an HTTPS website or an Android app, the API will ensure that any statements
   * used to generate the response have been made in a secure way by the owner of
   * that asset.  Conversely, if the source asset is an insecure HTTP website
   * (that is, the URL starts with `http://` instead of `https://`), the API
   * cannot verify its statements securely, and it is not possible to ensure that
   * the website's statements have not been altered by a third party.  For more
   * information, see the [Digital Asset Links technical design
   * specification](https://github.com/google/digitalassetlinks/blob/master/well-
   * known/details.md). (assetlinks.check)
   *
   * @param array $optParams Optional parameters.
   *
   * @opt_param string target.androidApp.packageName Android App assets are
   * naturally identified by their Java package name. For example, the Google Maps
   * app uses the package name `com.google.android.apps.maps`. REQUIRED
   * @opt_param string source.androidApp.certificate.sha256Fingerprint The
   * uppercase SHA-265 fingerprint of the certificate.  From the PEM  certificate,
   * it can be acquired like this:
   *
   *     $ keytool -printcert -file $CERTFILE | grep SHA256:     SHA256:
   * 14:6D:E9:83:C5:73:06:50:D8:EE:B9:95:2F:34:FC:64:16:A0:83: \
   * 42:E6:1D:BE:A8:8A:04:96:B2:3F:CF:44:E5
   *
   * or like this:
   *
   *     $ openssl x509 -in $CERTFILE -noout -fingerprint -sha256     SHA256
   * Fingerprint=14:6D:E9:83:C5:73:06:50:D8:EE:B9:95:2F:34:FC:64: \
   * 16:A0:83:42:E6:1D:BE:A8:8A:04:96:B2:3F:CF:44:E5
   *
   * In this example, the contents of this field would be `14:6D:E9:83:C5:73:
   * 06:50:D8:EE:B9:95:2F:34:FC:64:16:A0:83:42:E6:1D:BE:A8:8A:04:96:B2:3F:CF:
   * 44:E5`.
   *
   * If these tools are not available to you, you can convert the PEM certificate
   * into the DER format, compute the SHA-256 hash of that string and represent
   * the result as a hexstring (that is, uppercase hexadecimal representations of
   * each octet, separated by colons).
   * @opt_param string relation Query string for the relation.
   *
   * We identify relations with strings of the format `/`, where `` must be one of
   * a set of pre-defined purpose categories, and `` is a free-form lowercase
   * alphanumeric string that describes the specific use case of the statement.
   *
   * Refer to [our API documentation](/digital-asset-links/v1/relation-strings)
   * for the current list of supported relations.
   *
   * For a query to match an asset link, both the query's and the asset link's
   * relation strings must match exactly.
   *
   * Example: A query with relation `delegate_permission/common.handle_all_urls`
   * matches an asset link with relation
   * `delegate_permission/common.handle_all_urls`.
   * @opt_param string target.web.site Web assets are identified by a URL that
   * contains only the scheme, hostname and port parts.  The format is
   *
   *     http[s]://[:]
   *
   * Hostnames must be fully qualified: they must end in a single period ("`.`").
   *
   * Only the schemes "http" and "https" are currently allowed.
   *
   * Port numbers are given as a decimal number, and they must be omitted if the
   * standard port numbers are used: 80 for http and 443 for https.
   *
   * We call this limited URL the "site".  All URLs that share the same scheme,
   * hostname and port are considered to be a part of the site and thus belong to
   * the web asset.
   *
   * Example: the asset with the site `https://www.google.com` contains all these
   * URLs:
   *
   *   *   `https://www.google.com/`   *   `https://www.google.com:443/`   *
   * `https://www.google.com/foo`   *   `https://www.google.com/foo?bar`   *
   * `https://www.google.com/foo#bar`   *
   * `https://user@password:www.google.com/`
   *
   * But it does not contain these URLs:
   *
   *   *   `http://www.google.com/`       (wrong scheme)   *
