   * @param string $parent Service for which search is performed.
   * services/{service} {service} the name of a service, for example
   * 'service.googleapis.com'.
   * @param array $optParams Optional parameters.
   *
   * @opt_param string pageToken The continuation token, which is used to page
   * through large result sets. To get the next page of results, set this
   * parameter to the value of `nextPageToken` from the previous response.
   *
   * Optional.
   * @opt_param int pageSize The maximum number of results returned by this
   * request. Currently, the default maximum is set to 1000. If page_size is not
   * provided or the size provided is a number larger than 1000, it will be
   * automatically set to 1000.
   *
   * Optional.
   * @opt_param string query Set a query `{expression}` for querying tenancy
   * units. Your `{expression}` must be in the format:
   * `field_name=literal_string`. The `field_name` is the name of the field you
   * want to compare. Supported fields are `tenant_resources.tag` and
   * `tenant_resources.resource`.
   *
   * For example, to search tenancy units that contain at least one tenant
   * resource with given tag 'xyz', use query `tenant_resources.tag=xyz`. To
   * search tenancy units that contain at least one tenant resource with given
   * resource name 'projects/123456', use query
   * `tenant_resources.resource=projects/123456`.
   *
   * Multiple expressions can be joined with `AND`s. Tenancy units must match all
   * expressions to be included in the result set. For example,
   * `tenant_resources.tag=xyz AND tenant_resources.resource=projects/123456`
   *
   * Optional.
