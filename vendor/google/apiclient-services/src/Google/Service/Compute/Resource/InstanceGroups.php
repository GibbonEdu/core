   *
   * For example, to filter for instances that do not have a name of example-
   * instance, you would use filter=name ne example-instance.
   *
   * You can filter on nested fields. For example, you could filter on instances
   * that have set the scheduling.automaticRestart field to true. Use filtering on
   * nested fields to take advantage of labels to organize and search for results
   * based on label values.
   *
   * To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
   * parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart eq true) (zone eq us-
   * central1-f). Multiple expressions are treated as AND expressions, meaning
   * that resources must match all expressions to pass the filters.
