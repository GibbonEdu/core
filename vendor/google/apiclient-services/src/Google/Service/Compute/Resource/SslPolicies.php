   * @opt_param string filter A filter expression that filters resources listed in

   *
   * For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude

   *
   * You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
   * scheduling.automaticRestart = false to include instances only if they are not
   * scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to
   * filter based on resource labels.
   *
   * To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within

   * "Intel Skylake"). By default, each expression is an AND expression. However,
