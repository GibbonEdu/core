  /**

   * @param Google_Service_CloudComposer_Environment $postBody
   * @param array $optParams Optional parameters.
   *
   * @opt_param string updateMask Required. A comma-separated list of paths,
   * relative to `Environment`, of fields to update. For example, to set the
   * version of scikit-learn to install in the environment to 0.19.0 and to remove
   * an existing installation of numpy, the `updateMask` parameter would include
   * the following two `paths` values: "config.softwareConfig.pypiPackages.scikit-
   * learn" and "config.softwareConfig.pypiPackages.numpy". The included patch
   * environment would specify the scikit-learn version as follows:
   *
   *     {       "config":{         "softwareConfig":{           "pypiPackages":{
   * "scikit-learn":"==0.19.0"           }         }       }     }
   *
   * Note that in the above example, any existing PyPI packages other than scikit-
   * learn and numpy will be unaffected.
   *
   * Only one update type may be included in a single request's `updateMask`. For
   * example, one cannot update both the PyPI packages and labels in the same
   * request. However, it is possible to update multiple members of a map field
   * simultaneously in the same request. For example, to set the labels "label1"
   * and "label2" while clearing "label3" (assuming it already exists), one can
   * provide the paths "labels.label1", "labels.label2", and "labels.label3" and
   * populate the patch environment as follows:
   *
   *     {       "labels":{         "label1":"new-label1-value"         "label2
   * ":"new-label2-value"       }     }
   *
   * Note that in the above example, any existing labels that are not included in
   * the `updateMask` will be unaffected.
   *
   * It is also possible to replace an entire map field by providing the map
   * field's path in the `updateMask`. The new value of the field will be that
   * which is provided in the patch environment. For example, to delete all pre-
   * existing user-specified PyPI packages and install botocore at version 1.7.14,
   * the `updateMask` would contain the path "config.softwareConfig.pypiPackages",
   * and the patch environment would be the following:
   *
   *     {       "config":{         "softwareConfig":{           "pypiPackages":{
   * "botocore":"==1.7.14"           }         }       }     }
   *
   * **Note:** Only the following fields can be updated:
   *
   *        Mask  Purpose      config.softwareConfig.pypiPackages    Replace all
   * custom custom PyPI packages. If a replacement  package map is not included in
   * `environment`, all custom  PyPI packages are cleared. It is an error to
   * provide both this mask and a  mask specifying an individual package.
   * config.softwareConfig.pypiPackages.packagename  Update the custom PyPI
   * package packagename,  preserving other packages. To delete the package,
   * include it in  `updateMask`, and omit the mapping for it in
   * `environment.config.softwareConfig.pypiPackages`. It is an error  to provide
   * both a mask of this form and the  "config.softwareConfig.pypiPackages" mask.
   * labels  Replace all environment labels. If a replacement labels map is not
   * included in `environment`, all labels are cleared. It is an error to  provide
   * both this mask and a mask specifying one or more individual  labels.
   * labels.labelName  Set the label named labelName, while preserving other
   * labels. To delete the label, include it in `updateMask` and omit its  mapping
   * in `environment.labels`. It is an error to provide both a  mask of this form
   * and the "labels" mask.      config.nodeCount  Horizontally scale the number
   * of nodes in the environment. An integer  greater than or equal to 3 must be
   * provided in the `config.nodeCount` field.
   * config.softwareConfig.airflowConfigOverrides  Replace all Apache Airflow
   * config overrides. If a replacement config  overrides map is not included in
   * `environment`, all config overrides  are cleared.  It is an error to provide
   * both this mask and a mask specifying one or  more individual config
   * overrides.      config.softwareConfig.airflowConfigOverrides.section-name
   * Override the Apache Airflow config property name in the  section named
   * section, preserving other properties. To delete  the property override,
   * include it in `updateMask` and omit its mapping  in
   * `environment.config.softwareConfig.airflowConfigOverrides`.  It is an error
   * to provide both a mask of this form and the
   * "config.softwareConfig.airflowConfigOverrides" mask.
   * config.softwareConfig.envVariables  Replace all environment variables. If a
   * replacement environment  variable map is not included in `environment`, all
   * custom environment  variables  are cleared.  It is an error to provide both
   * this mask and a mask specifying one or  more individual environment
   * variables.
