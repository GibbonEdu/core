  /**
   * Lists all resources in a given deployment. (resources.listResources)

   * @param string $project The project ID for this request.
   * @param string $deployment The name of the deployment for this request.
   * @param array $optParams Optional parameters.
   *
   * @opt_param string filter A filter expression that filters resources listed in
   * the response. The expression must specify the field name, a comparison
   * operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be
   * a string, a number, or a boolean. The comparison operator must be either =,
   * !=, >, or <.
   *
   * For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude
   * instances named example-instance by specifying name != example-instance.
   *
   * You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
   * scheduling.automaticRestart = false to include instances only if they are not
   * scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to
   * filter based on resource labels.
   *
   * To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
   * parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform =
   * "Intel Skylake"). By default, each expression is an AND expression. However,
   * you can include AND and OR expressions explicitly. For example, (cpuPlatform
   * = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
   * (scheduling.automaticRestart = true).
   * @opt_param string maxResults The maximum number of results per page that
   * should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than
   * maxResults, Compute Engine returns a nextPageToken that can be used to get
   * the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are 0
   * to 500, inclusive. (Default: 500)
   * @opt_param string orderBy Sorts list results by a certain order. By default,
   * results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.
   *
   * You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp
   * using orderBy="creationTimestamp desc". This sorts results based on the
   * creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result first).
   * Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is
   * returned first.
   *
   * Currently, only sorting by name or creationTimestamp desc is supported.
   * @opt_param string pageToken Specifies a page token to use. Set pageToken to
   * the nextPageToken returned by a previous list request to get the next page of
   * results.
