   * Sets or updates the billing account associated with a project. You specify

   * `ProjectBillingInfo` resource to the resource name of a billing account.
   * Associating a project with an open billing account enables billing on the
   * project and allows charges for resource usage. If the project already had a
   * billing account, this method changes the billing account used for resource
   * usage charges. *Note:* Incurred charges that have not yet been reported in
   * the transaction history of the Google Developers Console may be billed to the
   * new billing account, even if the charge occurred before the new billing
   * account was assigned to the project. The current authenticated user must have
   * ownership privileges for both the [project](https://cloud.google.com/docs
   * /permissions-overview#h.bgs0oxofvnoo ) and the [billing
   * account](https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/4430947). You can disable
   * billing on the project by setting the `billing_account_name` field to empty.
   * This action disassociates the current billing account from the project. Any
   * billable activity of your in-use services will stop, and your application
   * could stop functioning as expected. Any unbilled charges to date will be
   * billed to the previously associated account. The current authenticated user
   * must be either an owner of the project or an owner of the billing account for
   * the project. Note that associating a project with a *closed* billing account
   * will have much the same effect as disabling billing on the project: any paid
   * resources used by the project will be shut down. Thus, unless you wish to
   * disable billing, you should always call this method with the name of an
   * *open* billing account. (projects.updateBillingInfo)
