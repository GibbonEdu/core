   * @param array $optParams Optional parameters.
   *
   * @opt_param string interval.endTime Required. The end of the time interval.
   * @opt_param string aggregation.alignmentPeriod The alignment period for per-
   * time series alignment. If present, alignmentPeriod must be at least 60
   * seconds. After per-time series alignment, each time series will contain data
   * points only on the period boundaries. If perSeriesAligner is not specified or
   * equals ALIGN_NONE, then this field is ignored. If perSeriesAligner is
   * specified and does not equal ALIGN_NONE, then this field must be defined;
   * otherwise an error is returned.
   * @opt_param int pageSize A positive number that is the maximum number of
   * results to return. If page_size is empty or more than 100,000 results, the
   * effective page_size is 100,000 results. If view is set to FULL, this is the
   * maximum number of Points returned. If view is set to HEADERS, this is the
   * maximum number of TimeSeries returned.
   * @opt_param string orderBy Unsupported: must be left blank. The points in each
   * time series are returned in reverse time order.
   * @opt_param string aggregation.crossSeriesReducer The approach to be used to
   * combine time series. Not all reducer functions may be applied to all time
   * series, depending on the metric type and the value type of the original time
   * series. Reduction may change the metric type of value type of the time
   * series.Time series data must be aligned in order to perform cross-time series
   * reduction. If crossSeriesReducer is specified, then perSeriesAligner must be
   * specified and not equal ALIGN_NONE and alignmentPeriod must be specified;
   * otherwise, an error is returned.
   * @opt_param string filter A monitoring filter that specifies which time series
   * should be returned. The filter must specify a single metric type, and can
   * additionally specify metric labels and other information. For example:
   * metric.type = "compute.googleapis.com/instance/cpu/usage_time" AND
   * metric.label.instance_name = "my-instance-name"
   * @opt_param string aggregation.perSeriesAligner The approach to be used to
   * align individual time series. Not all alignment functions may be applied to
   * all time series, depending on the metric type and value type of the original
   * time series. Alignment may change the metric type or the value type of the
   * time series.Time series data must be aligned in order to perform cross-time
   * series reduction. If crossSeriesReducer is specified, then perSeriesAligner
   * must be specified and not equal ALIGN_NONE and alignmentPeriod must be
   * specified; otherwise, an error is returned.
   * @opt_param string pageToken If this field is not empty then it must contain
   * the nextPageToken value returned by a previous call to this method. Using
   * this field causes the method to return additional results from the previous
   * method call.
   * @opt_param string interval.startTime Optional. The beginning of the time
   * interval. The default value for the start time is the end time. The start
   * time must not be later than the end time.
   * @opt_param string view Specifies which information is returned about the time
   * series.
   * @opt_param string aggregation.groupByFields The set of fields to preserve
   * when crossSeriesReducer is specified. The groupByFields determine how the
   * time series are partitioned into subsets prior to applying the aggregation
   * function. Each subset contains time series that have the same value for each
   * of the grouping fields. Each individual time series is a member of exactly
   * one subset. The crossSeriesReducer is applied to each subset of time series.
   * It is not possible to reduce across different resource types, so this field
   * implicitly contains resource.type. Fields not specified in groupByFields are
   * aggregated away. If groupByFields is not specified and all the time series
   * have the same resource type, then the time series are aggregated into a
   * single output time series. If crossSeriesReducer is not defined, this field
   * is ignored.
