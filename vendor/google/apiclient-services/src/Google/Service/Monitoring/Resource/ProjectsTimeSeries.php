   * @param string $name The project on which to execute the request. The format
   * is "projects/{project_id_or_number}".
   * @param array $optParams Optional parameters.
   *
   * @opt_param string filter A [monitoring filter](/monitoring/api/v3/filters)
   * that specifies which time series should be returned. The filter must specify
   * a single metric type, and can additionally specify metric labels and other
   * information. For example: metric.type =
   * "compute.googleapis.com/instance/cpu/usage_time" AND
   * metric.label.instance_name = "my-instance-name"
   * @opt_param string interval.endTime Required. The end of the interval. The
   * interval includes this time.
   * @opt_param string interval.startTime If this value is omitted, the interval
   * is a point in time, `endTime`. If `startTime` is present, it must be earlier
   * than (less than) `endTime`. The interval begins after `startTime`â€”it does not
   * include `startTime`.
   * @opt_param string aggregation.alignmentPeriod The alignment period for
   * per-[time series](TimeSeries) alignment. If present, `alignmentPeriod` must
   * be at least 60 seconds. After per-time series alignment, each time series
   * will contain data points only on the period boundaries. If `perSeriesAligner`
   * is not specified or equals `ALIGN_NONE`, then this field is ignored. If
   * `perSeriesAligner` is specified and does not equal `ALIGN_NONE`, then this
   * field must be defined; otherwise an error is returned.
   * @opt_param string aggregation.perSeriesAligner The approach to be used to
   * align individual time series. Not all alignment functions may be applied to
   * all time series, depending on the metric type and value type of the original
   * time series. Alignment may change the metric type or the value type of the
   * time series. Time series data must be aligned in order to perform cross-time
   * series reduction. If `crossSeriesReducer` is specified, then
   * `perSeriesAligner` must be specified and not equal `ALIGN_NONE` and
   * `alignmentPeriod` must be specified; otherwise, an error is returned.
   * @opt_param string aggregation.crossSeriesReducer The approach to be used to
   * combine time series. Not all reducer functions may be applied to all time
   * series, depending on the metric type and the value type of the original time
   * series. Reduction may change the metric type of value type of the time
   * series. Time series data must be aligned in order to perform cross-time
   * series reduction. If `crossSeriesReducer` is specified, then
   * `perSeriesAligner` must be specified and not equal `ALIGN_NONE` and
   * `alignmentPeriod` must be specified; otherwise, an error is returned.
   * @opt_param string aggregation.groupByFields The set of fields to preserve
   * when `crossSeriesReducer` is specified. The `groupByFields` determine how the
   * time series are partitioned into subsets prior to applying the aggregation
   * function. Each subset contains time series that have the same value for each
   * of the grouping fields. Each individual time series is a member of exactly
   * one subset. The `crossSeriesReducer` is applied to each subset of time
   * series. Fields not specified in `groupByFields` are aggregated away. If
   * `groupByFields` is not specified, the time series are aggregated into a
   * single output time series. If `crossSeriesReducer` is not defined, this field
   * is ignored.
   * @opt_param string orderBy Specifies the order in which the points of the time
   * series should be returned. By default, results are not ordered. Currently,
   * this field must be left blank.
   * @opt_param string view Specifies which information is returned about the time
   * series.
   * @opt_param int pageSize A positive number that is the maximum number of
   * results to return. When `view` field sets to `FULL`, it limits the number of
   * `Points` server will return; if `view` field is `HEADERS`, it limits the
   * number of `TimeSeries` server will return.
   * @opt_param string pageToken If this field is not empty then it must contain
   * the `nextPageToken` value returned by a previous call to this method. Using
   * this field causes the method to return additional results from the previous
   * method call.
